**Item #:** SCP-X

**Object Class:** Safe
  
**Special Containment Procedures:**

**Description:**

SCP-X is a gelatenous substance composed primarily of ___ mol ______ _____, ____ mol ___ _____, and 0.13 mol crystalised silver halide.
When exposed to light, SCP-X acts the way film photography does, --- elaborate ---. It suffices to layer SCP-X in --- elaborate --- for use in a standard film photography camera.
Taking an image requires no electrical power source and emits no abnormal radiation. 
Once developed, the images captured by SCP-X range from being identical to, similar to or entirely different from the intended subject.

As an example, in test SCP-X-T408 two photographs of Agent M Croft was taken in rec room ___: each using a Minolta ____ camera with non-SCP-X or SCP-X film.
Croft can be seen wearing the standard-issue grey suit in the non-SCP-X film photograph; the other showed Croft in 16th century armour and sunglasses. 
SCP-X-T408 is one of ____ tests. Tests of interest are given by Appendix A.

It is unclear what the differences between captured and developed images signify, though it is highly unlikely that they are caused by artefacts^1 or are psychological^2. 
A more accepted theory proposed by Dr. I _____ suggests that SCP-X possesses anomalous properties that facilitate an inter dimensional faster-than-light exchange of mutual information between quantum entangled particles.
When exposed to light, the photons (in the range of visible light) exposed to SCP-X are instantaneously exchanged with those exposed to SCP-X in an alternate reality.
Assuming an infinite number of parallel universes, there are infinitely many photographs being taken at all times by alternate versions of the photographer.

## History

The first known instance of SCP-X was synthesized in 1901 by the Lumi√©re brothers in Lyon, France.
SCP-X was one of several prototypes developed during the brothers' experimentaton with colour photography.
Each prototype was tested on colour-rich and vibrant subjects, and the subjective quality of each image was reported and compared. 
Reports ** show that the images produced by SCP-X were distorted and demonstrated poorer colour than other prototypes, and further experiments were abandoned.
It is likely, however, that the brothers' had outsourced the experiements to several graduate *stagieres* and that the poor results of SCP-X were due to incompetence.

It would not be until 1970 that the FORMULA for SCP-X would be re-discovered by Dr. I  ____, who was at the time conducting research in the methods for documenting photo-evasive anomalies (see SCP-096). 
Her background in chemistry, theoretical physics and quantum entanglement primed interest in SCP-X, hypothesising that SCP-X may posess inter dimensional properties, thus officially classifying it as an SCP.
